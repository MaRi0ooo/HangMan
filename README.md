# Description
Hangman is a words guessing game for one player. The computer guesses a word and the user has to suggest letters one by one. Every time the word contains a letter, the computer opens it (all of them, if there are a few). Every time the word doesn't contain a letter, the computer gives a penalty point for the user. If there are five penalty points, the user looses. If there are no hidden letters anymore, the computer looses.
